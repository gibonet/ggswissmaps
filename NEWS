ggswissmaps 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Merged pull request from @teunbrand 
  (https://github.com/gibonet/ggswissmaps/pull/1): 
  replaced `ggplot2::aes_string()` (deprecated) with 
  `ggplot2::aes()` in function `maps2_()`.
* Removed `plyr`, `reshape2` and `data.table` from "Suggests".
* Added `sf` to "Suggests".
* Moved `ggplot2` from "Depends" to "Imports". 
* Added the 8 maps in `sf` format.
* Added a vignette "`ggswissmaps` data with `sf`", 
  with some examples of how  to use `ggswissmaps` data 
  in `sf` format.
* Changed/corrected a broken url
* Added the argument caption to function maps2_(), 
  with default value "Boundaries: BFS GEOSTAT / swisstopo". 
  The caption will be included in the lower right corner 
  of the map 



ggswissmaps 0.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The object `maps2` is now created when the package is loaded. This has
  reduced the installed size of the package to about 1 MB.


ggswissmaps 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The code of the `maps2_()` function has been shortened, with the introduction
  of `theme_white_f`. The result of the function is the same.
* The number of data frames with map coordinates has been reduced
  from 16 to 8 (`shp_df` data). 
* Object `theme_white` has been deleted. This object used `panel.margin` 
  argument, that will be deprecated in the next release of `ggplot2`. 
  Instead of changing it to the new argument `panel.spacing`, we deleted it
  since in any case it was no more used and neither exported to the NAMESPACE.
* Added single quotes around `ggplot2` in DESCRIPTION and other documentation.


ggswissmaps 0.0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* New README.md file, with installation instructions.
* Added `rmarkdown` to suggested dependencies.

ggswissmaps 0.0.8
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added function `maps2_()`

  available simply by writing it (it is no more necessary to load it with `data
  (maps2))`.
* The size of the package source (tar.gz) has been reduced form about 1.5 MB
  to 0.6 MB.
